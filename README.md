## Hi, I'm Sharvi Belsare 👋

Frontend-focused developer who enjoys building **clean, scalable UI systems** and thinking deeply about **frontend architecture, state management, and performance**.

I work at the intersection of **design, development, and product**, with a strong interest in how decisions made *before writing code* shape long-term usability and scalability.

---

### 🧠 What I Work On
- Frontend architecture for SaaS products
- Reusable, component-driven UI systems
- Managing complex state and data flow in real applications
- Performance and optimization considerations in frontend builds
- Translating product and business requirements into usable interfaces

### 🤖 AI & Modern SaaS Experience
I’ve worked on AI-powered SaaS tools, including projects in health tech and edtech, where I:
- Integrated **OpenAI APIs**
- Worked with AI assistants and AI-driven workflows
- Considered UX implications of AI features, not just API calls

---

### 🧩 Side Projects & Interests
Outside of work, I enjoy building **tools** — especially products inspired by platforms like **Figma, Canva, and low-code systems**.

I’m particularly interested in:
- Tooling that empowers creators and developers
- Configuration-driven UIs
- Systems that balance flexibility with simplicity

---

### 🚀 Current Focus
- Strengthening frontend architecture decisions
- Improving state management patterns
- Learning performance optimization techniques
- Building UIs that scale as products grow

I’m actively working toward becoming a **good frontend engineer** by focusing on *why* systems are designed a certain way not just *how* they’re implemented.

⚡ *I believe good frontend engineering is as much about thinking as it is about writing code.*
